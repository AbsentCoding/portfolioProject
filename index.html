        </h2>
        <p>Hola! It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Javier and i'd like to personally welcome you to my little corner of the internet, otherwise known as my portfolio page. 
            I am actively working towards improving myself and my skillsets. I am relatively new to the world of coding but i can confidently state that i love it and its seemingly endless potential. 
            Though i am very excited, I am aware that I still have much to learn. And so, this landing page serves as a benchmark and archive for my journey. 
        </p>
